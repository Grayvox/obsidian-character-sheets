# Character Sheets

Create character sheets for your very own traumatized little guys in Obsidian.

## Tested Platforms
- Windows
- Linux

Please do not anticipate support for mobile devices, unless I get a considerable amount of requests from users I am not going to be looking into it.

## I found a bug / I have a suggestion!
Great! I appreciate you taking the time to want to help out! Please go to the issues tab and follow the instructions based on why you're creating an issue. I encourage you to take screenshots or a video of the issue so we can get a better picture of what's going on and what needs to be fixed.

## How to use this plugin

1. Hit the "Create new character sheet" button on the ribbon bar (sidebar).
2. Select what kind of character sheet you want to generate.
3. Locate the character sheet inside the default (newly generated) `Characters` folder.
4. Fill in and edit the new sheet to your heart's content - all the basic needs for a character are already there!
5. Realize how easy this was - and that the developer must be a genius to have made something so easy to use.

*Psst, hey, step four is my favorite.*

## Some background

A friend of mine shared with me this idea they had a while back for a full featured writing app - while we never found it nor found the time to make the app ourselves as of writing, we *did* stumble across Obsidian! We fell in love instantly, and being the one that does more coding, I took it upon myself to add one of the core features we hoped to get out of a writing app: Character Sheets!
